# Write a JVM with Rust

This project is inspired by this blog: [How to write a (toy) JVM](https://zserge.com/posts/jvm/), and I think it's a good idea to write a JVM with Rust. I've always want to write something, something challenging, and something useful. But those huge projects are not a good start point for me. I need a break-down plan to achieve my goal. Fortunately, I found this blog, and I think it's a good start point for me.

The progress may be very slow, since I can write it only with my spare time, and the overtime of my job is serious.
